pc gamers should be aware the nonsense dell is trying to pull
always loved how ezios character progressed as he aged
im sold
this was one of the bigger accomplishments in all my years of gaming

hypothetical situation warning goes against the rgaming circlejerk narrative

theres so much misinformation on this and its one of the best features of the xbox one
my morning has been slow too
xboxone so good its a pc
check out the d model of the ps in your browser

the smile of a man who just won
the applause was thunderous gg microsoft
my first thought when watching the division gameplay
the xbox one vs ps starts reminding me of this scene
xbox one supports xbox controllers
i would buy the shit out this the division
blows my mind developers like naughty dog will make next gen graphics a treat the last of us
microsoft not doing reputation management on reddit you say then take a look at this
played the last of us and was completely amused by this part somewhat of a spoiler
its not even worth it at that price
the world of gaming has reached a new low fixed

to all those who say the last of us was sad heavy rain
list of unbiased xbox one facts all information sourced xpost rxboxone
gotta give bungie some credit for managing this for all of us
found this tucked away in the back of a bar anybody remember this game
